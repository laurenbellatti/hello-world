# hello-world
Oh hey, y'all.
My name is Lauren and I’m a Texas/Tennessee transplant studying the craft of story at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. If you need me, you can probably find me either acting as a professional queso critic (call it "cheese dip" and we can't be friends) or color-coding my planner. I believe art and education are two invaluable forms storytelling, for they preserve the past while propelling us into the future. Whether I’m rambling through a new city, exploring the pages of a book, or delving into a writing project, I’m all about adventures that cultivate community through story.
